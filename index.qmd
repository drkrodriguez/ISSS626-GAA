Welcome to my website for my work in the course [**ISSS 626 - Geospatial Analytics and Applications**]{.underline} during the August term of 2024 under **Dr Kam Tin Seong**.

The course covers theory and methods of geospatial analysis and the tools in R to implement such analyses.

## Hands-On Exercises

Hands-on exercises are assigned before each lesson to give us hands-on experience in using R on the geospatial analysis methods and functions we learned. We are given step-by-step instructions and explanations which complement our pre-class reading, and prepares us for the in-class exercises.

1.  [Geospatial Data Wrangling with R](Hands-on/Hands-on_Ex01/Hands-on_Ex01.html) (for Session 1, 26 Aug '24)

2.  [Choropleth Mapping with R](Hands-on/Hands-on_Ex02/Hands-on_Ex02.html) (for Session 1, 26 Aug '24)
