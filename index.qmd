Welcome to my website for my work in the course [**ISSS 626 - Geospatial Analytics and Applications**]{.underline} during the August term of 2024 under **Dr Kam Tin Seong**.

The course covers theory and methods of geospatial analysis and the tools in R to implement such analyses.

## Hands-On Exercises

Hands-on exercises are assigned before each lesson to give us hands-on experience in using R on the geospatial analysis methods and functions we learned. We are given step-by-step instructions and explanations (through Dr Kam's online [book](https://r4gdsa.netlify.app/ "R for Geospatial Data Science and Analytics by Dr Kam")) which complement our pre-class reading, and prepares us for the in-class exercises.

1.  [Geospatial Data Wrangling with R](Hands-on/Hands-on_Ex01/Hands-on_Ex01.html) (for Session 1, 26 Aug '24)

2.  [Choropleth Mapping with R](Hands-on/Hands-on_Ex02/Hands-on_Ex02.html) (for Session 1, 26 Aug '24)

3.  [1st Order Spatial Point Patterns Analysis Methods](Hands-on/Hands-on_Ex03/Hands-on_Ex03.html) (for Session 2, 2 Sept '24)

4.  [2nd Order Spatial Point Patterns Analysis Methods](%22Hands-on/Hands-on_Ex04/Hands-on_Ex04.html%22) (for Session 2, 2 Sept '24)

5.  [Network Constrained Spatial Point Pattern Analysis](%22Hands-on/Hands-on_Ex05/Hands-on_Ex05.html%22) (for Session 3, 9 Sept 2024)

## In-Class Exercises

In each session, we go through a hands-on exercise to revise the readings for the lesson. The objective of these is to further reinforce the concepts and tools learned in the readings and in the take-home exercise. These will also go further into the analysis and interpretation of results.

1.  [Introduction to Geospatial Analytics](In-class/In-class_Ex01/In-class_Ex01.html) (26 Aug '24)

2.  [Spatial Point Pattern Analysis](%22In-class/In-class_Ex02/In-class_Ex02.html%22) (2 Sept '24)

3.  Advanced Spatial Point Patterns Analysis (9 Sept '24)
