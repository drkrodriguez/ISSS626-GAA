## A.4 Importing and Launching R Packages

(WIP) For this study, XXX R packages will be used. A description of the packages and the code, using `p_load()` of the **pacman** package, to import them is given below.

As we will be performing simulations in the analysis later, it is good practice to define a random seed to be used so that results are consistent for viewers of this report, and the results can be reproduced.

`{r} set.seed(1234)}`
