Getting Started\n\n## A.1 Background\n\nThe [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialinclusion/overview) defines **financial inclusion** as the state of having access to useful and affordable financial products to meet one's needs. Financial inclusion is an enabler to 7 of the Sustainable Development Goals, and is seen as the key enabler to reduce extreme poverty.\n\nOne key dimension of financial inclusion that the World Bank looked at in their latest [Global Findex Database 2021](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex) is the ownership of bank accounts for adults. In this report, 76% of the global adult population have their own accounts, but only 71% of the developing nations' do. In some countries like Tanzania this number is even lower at 52%. Banking is just one traditional dimension. Other vehicles like mobile payments can bridge the gap in access to services for some of these nations.\n\nTanzania recognizes the importance of financial inclusion in promoting economic growth and with the Bank of Tanzania, the country's central bank, the Microfinance Policy of 2000 was developed and focused on expanding financial services for low-income individuals.\n\nThe program behind financial inclusion has been structured from 2014 with the first National Financial Inclusion Framework for 2014-2016, with the latest version being the third framework for 2023-2028. While there has been significant progress, (e.g., access to financial services has risen from 42% in 2013 to 89% in 2023) the country continues to aim for inclusion for the whole population by increasing access, encouraging usage and enhancing the quality of financial services.\n\n## A.2 Objectives\n\nFinscope Tanzania 2023 is a public-private sector collaboration and aimed, among others, to understand and describe the financial behavior of individuals in the country and to establish an updated view of the level of financial inclusion across various measures. A large part of the findings is showing the change (improvements) of the overall measures against the previous 2017 report.\n\nThe objective of this study is to build on the Finscope Tanzania 2023 by identifying influential variables and identifying if geospatial factors influence the effect of those variables.\n\nIn order to satisfy this, the specific deliverables for the study will be:\n\n-   to build a global or non-spatial explanatory model for the level of financial inclusion across Tanzania;\n\n-   to build a geographically weighted explanatory model for the same response variables; and,\n\n-   to assess the advantage of the geographically weighted model and to analyse the geographically weighted model\n\n## A.3 Data Sources\n\nThe following data sources are used for this analysis:\n\n-   Finscope Tanzania 2023 individual survey data from [Finscope Tanzania](https://www.fsdt.or.tz/finscope/)\n\n    -   The dataset is contained in a csv and translates the responses from 9,915 individuals who answered the survey\n\n    -   The respondents are all adults aged 16 years and above take across Tanzania\n\n    -   The dataset also includes derived fields which include different indicators for financial inclusion based on different criteria\n\n-   District-level boundaries in Tanzania as a shapefile from [geoBoundaries.org](https://www.geoboundaries.org/) portal\n\n## A.4 Importing and Launching R Packages\n\nFor this study, the following R packages will be used. A description of the packages and the code, using `p_load()` of the **pacman** package, to import them is given below.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### Package Description\n\nThe loaded packages include:\n\n-   **olsrr -** for building OLS (ordinary least squares) regression models and performing diagnostic tests\n\n-   **GWmodel -** for calibrating geographically weighted family of models\n\n-   **tmap -** for plotting cartographic quality maps\n\n-   **ggstatsplot** - for multivariate data visualization and analysis\n\n-   **sf** - spatial data handling\n\n-   **tidyverse** - attribute data handling\n\n#### Import Code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(olsrr, sf, GWmodel, tmap, tidyverse, ggstatsplot)\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n# B. Data Loading and Preparation\n\n## B.1 Loading Tanzania District boundaries\n\nWe load the district level boundaries in the following code chunk using `st_read()` and indicating the appropriate layer name. (i.e., the level 2 map)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntz_dist <- st_read(dsn=\"data/geospatial\", \n                   layer=\"geoBoundaries-TZA-ADM2\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nReading layer `geoBoundaries-TZA-ADM2' from data source \n  `C:\\drkrodriguez\\ISSS626-GAA\\Take-home\\Take-home_Ex03\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 170 features and 5 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 29.58953 ymin: -11.76235 xmax: 40.44473 ymax: -0.983143\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe output shows that there are 170 objects loaded which corresponds to individual districts. The object is also of multipolygon class which could indicate that there are districts with discontinuous land areas, like islands.\n\nWe can create a simple map to visualize the boundaries using `qtm()` from **tmap**.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqtm(tz_dist, text = \"shapeName\", text.size = 0.4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex03_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## B.2 Deriving District centroids\n\nBefore we load the aspatial data, we will process the district boundary map to be able to use it for future operations with the other dataset. One step that needs to be done is to define representative points, which can be the centroids for the boundary map. The primary purpose of this is to be able to map the aspatial data for a district into a single location. In order to do this, the first step is to convert the multipolygon layer object into a polygon object which will allow for proper centroid calculations for each district.\n\nWe use the code chunk below to convert the sf object into polygons using `st_cast()` and then create a column for each individual polygon's area using `mutate()` with `st_area()`. We then use `groupby()` to reduce back the object to one row per district and then `filter()` to keep only the largest polygon for each district.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntz_dist_poly <- tz_dist %>%\n  st_cast(\"POLYGON\") %>%\n  mutate(area = st_area(.)) %>%\n  group_by(shapeName) %>%\n  filter(area == max(area)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  select(-area) %>%\n  select(shapeName)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in st_cast.sf(., \"POLYGON\"): repeating attributes for all\nsub-geometries for which they may not be constant\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can produce a map with tmap package to see if the operation had any irregular effects on the geography. In order to see the difference between the original map and the polygon map, we add the original map as the first layer in red, and then overlay the polygon map. The areas which now appear red are the polygons or areas that have been excluded from the original map to the polygon map.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntm_shape(tz_dist) +\n  tm_polygons(\"red\") +\ntm_shape(tz_dist_poly) +\n  tm_polygons(\"grey\") +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Full vs Poly Map\",\n            title.position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex03_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFrom the output, we see that in addition to a few small islands, there are three inland areas that have been excluded from the original map. While this produces holes in the new map, this might not be a big concern right now as long as the centroids we get from the remaining geometries is meaningful.\n\nIn order to generate the centroids, we can now use `st_centroid()` to compute them across each district's largest polygon.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntz_dist_centroids <- st_centroid(tz_dist_poly)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: st_centroid assumes attributes are constant over geometries\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can check the location of the centroids by plotting them as a layer on top of the original district boundary layer using tmap package in the code below.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntm_shape(tz_dist) +\n  tm_polygons(\"grey\") +\ntm_shape(tz_dist_centroids) +\n  tm_dots(\"green\", size = 0.2) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"District Centroids\",\n            title.position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex03_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe centroid locations look mostly acceptable, with a few exceptions where they might be lying somewhere away from the district boundaries given some of the districts have odd, nonconvex shapes.\n\n## B.2 Loading Finscope Tanzania 2023 Respondent Data\n\nWe can use `read_csv()` in the code chunk below to load the raw respondent data into an R object.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfstz23 <- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/FinScope Tanzania 2023_Individual Main Data_FINAL.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: One or more parsing issues, call `problems()` on your data frame for details,\ne.g.:\n  dat <- vroom(...)\n  problems(dat)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThere are 9915 rows or records, and 721 columns or fields. Most of these columns should not be relevant in meeting our objective, so it is advised to limit the data we work with to those meaningful variable. These variables should be our variable(s) of concern, or the dependent variable(s), and the variables that may contribute to it, or the independent variables.\n\n## B.4 Preparing Finscope Tanzania 2023 Respondent Data\n\n### B.4.1 Selecting potential variables\n\nThe first step in preparing the dataset is to reduce the data by keeping only the potentially relevant fields. This means identifying fields that can be used as is or to derive both the response variable(s) and the explanatory variables.\n\nThis is performed by scanning the datamap file (i.e., data dictionary) that accompanies the dataset. From there, we decide to keep only the following variables. We also change the variable names to a shorter and more recognizable one.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### Financial Inclusion (3)\n\n| Variable Name | Description | New Variable Name |\n|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|\n| BANKED | Classified as: Banked; Not Banked | fi_banked |\n| OVERALL_FORMAL | Classified as using formal instruments: Yes, No | fi_formal |\n| INFORMAL | Classified as using informal instruments: Yes, No | fi_informal |\n\n#### Geographic (4)\n\n|  Variable   |          Description           | New Variable Name |\n|:-----------:|:------------------------------:|:-----------------:|\n|  reg_name   |          Region name           |      region       |\n|  dist_name  |         District name          |     district      |\n|  ward_name  |           Ward name            |       ward        |\n| clustertype | Indicates if in rural or urban |       urban       |\n\n#### Demographic (11)\n\n| Variable Name | Description | New Variable Name |\n|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|\n| c8c | Age | age |\n| c9 | Gender: male. or female | female |\n| c10 | Marital status: married, divorced, widowed, single (4 levels) | maritalstatus |\n| c11 | Highest level education (10 levels of values) | education |\n| c2 | Head of household: respondent, not the respondent | head_hh |\n| c8n_a1 | Visually impaired: Yes, No | visual_impaired |\n| c8n_b1 | Hearing impaired: Yes, No | hearing_impaired |\n| c8n_c1 | Communication impaired: Yes, No | comm_impaired |\n| c8n_d1 | Movement impaired: Yes, No | move_impaired |\n| c8n_e1 | Difficulty with daily activities: Yes, No | daily_impaired |\n| c8n_f1 | Difficulty remembering and concentrating: Yes, No | cogn_impaired |\n\n#### Economic (8)\n\n| Variable Name | Description | New Variable Name |\n|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|\n| c12_1 | Land ownership (6 levels) | land_own |\n| c14 | Family involved in agriculture, fishing or aquaculture: Yes, No | agricultural |\n| c18_2 | Primary source of funds (12 levels) | source_of_funds |\n| c27\\_\\_17 | Has some form of ID: Yes, No | has_id |\n| D2_1\\_\\_1 | Receives salary from regular job: Yes, No | reg_job |\n| D2_1\\_\\_2 | Receives money from selling goods produced: Yes, No | production |\n| D2_1\\_\\_11 | Does not receive income: Yes, No | no_income |\n| IncomeMain | Derived variable for main source of income (14 levels) | income_source |\n\n#### Technographic (3)\n\n| Variable Name |             Description              | New Variable Name |\n|:-------------:|:------------------------------------:|:-----------------:|\n|   c23\\_\\_1    |   Access to mobile phone: No, Yes    |      mobile       |\n|   c23\\_\\_2    |     Access to internet: No, Yes      |     internet      |\n|     c24_1     | Personally own mobile phone: No, Yes |    own_mobile     |\n:::\n\nThe code block below compiles the 29 variables and their new names in two separate objects.
