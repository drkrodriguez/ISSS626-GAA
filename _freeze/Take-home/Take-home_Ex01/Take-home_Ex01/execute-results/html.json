We demonstrate how kernel density estimation can be used to visualize hotspots in a network constrained and non-network constrained context. We use different approaches to display charts side by side, especially to compare hotspots across different time dimensions or different conditions. Finally, we demonstrate how K- and G-functionss can be used to support any claims on the randomness, clustering or dispersion of a spatial point distribution.\n\n# A. Getting Started\n\n## A.1 Background\n\nRoad traffic accidents account for 1.19million deaths and up to 50 million non-fatal injuries according to a [report by the WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/road-traffic-injuries) last year.\n\nThe same report identifies major risk groups: low- and middle-income countries, (esp in Africa and Europe) the working population, and males. It also identifies some key risk factors which include human error, speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol, distracted driving, unsafe road infrastructure, unsafe vehicles, and law enforcement. Most of the factors identified are behavioral in nature but do not discount that other factors may also contribute to a higher risk of occurrence.\n\nWithin Southeast Asia, Thailand has ranked the highest in terms of incidence of road traffic accidents with an average number of of 20,000 deaths a year or 56 a day. The country has also seen an increase in the number of accidents from 2014 to 2021. A large 19% of these accidents occurred in national highways, and the chances of encountering an accident-prone zone was found to be 66%.\n\n## A.2 Objectives\n\nThis study aims to take a deeper look into the road accidents in Thailand, focusing on the [Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok_Metropolitan_Region) which contains the capital Bangkok, and five neighboring provinces. (Nonthaburi, Nakhon Pathom, Pathum Thani, Samut Prakan, Samut Sakhon)\n\nAs most literature has focused on behavioral and environmental factors, the study will focus on identifying spatiotemporal factors influencing the occurrence of road accidents in BMR. At the minimum, the study deliverables include the following:\n\n-   Visualization of spatiotemporal dynamics of road traffic accidents in BMR\n\n-   Detailed spatial analysis of road traffic accidents in BMR\n\n-   Detailed spatiotemporal analysis of road traffic accidents in BMR\n\nThe appropriate technique must be used for these deliverables and all the analysis and visualizations will be carried out using R.\n\n## A.3 Data Sources\n\nThe study makes use of the following datasets which are publicly available online.\n\n| Dataset Short Name | Description                                               | Datasource                                                                              |\n|------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| THRA               | Thailand road accident data from 2019 to 2022             | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thaweewatboy/thailand-road-accident-2019-2022) |\n| THOSM              | Thailand roads open street map in shapefile format        | [HDX](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_tha_roads)                                |\n| THSAB              | Thailand - Subnational Administrative Boudaries shapefile | [HDX](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-tha?)                                     |\n|                    |                                                           |                                                                                         |\n\n## A.4 Importing and Launching R Packages\n\nFor this study, four R packages will be used. A description of the packages and the code, using `p_load()` of the **pacman** package, to import them is given below.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### Package Description\n\nThe loaded packages include:\n\n-   **sf -** package for importing, managing and processing vector-based geospatial data\n\n-   **tidyverse -** collection of packages for performing data importation, wrangling and visualization\n\n-   **tmap -** package with functions for plotting cartographic quality maps\n\n-   **sPNetwork** - provides functions for performing SPPA methods like KDE and K-function on a network. The package can also be used to build spatial matrices to conduct traditional spatial analyses with spatial weights based on reticular distances\n\n-   **spatstat** - package for plotting, EDA and simulation of spatial data\n\n#### Import Code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf, spNetwork, tmap, tidyverse, spatstat)\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nAs we will be performing simulations in the analysis later, it is good practice to define a random seed to be used so that results are consistent for viewers of this report, and the results can be reproduced.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1234)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# B. Data Loading and Preparation\n\nIn this section, the appropriate R packages will be used to load the three datasets into R objects, and to inspect and transform them as needed.\n\n## B.1 Thailand Subnational Administrative Boundary, Shapefile\n\nWe load the Thailand subnational administrative boundary shapefile into an R dataframe using `st_read()` from the sf package. The source provides the geospatial data in varying levels as indicated by their suffix: country (0), province (1), district (2), and sub-district. (3) For focusing on the BMR, which covers Bangkok and neighboring provinces, province is the most likely level of detail we will need so we will use the code chunk below to load the appropriate layer first.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nthsab_prov <- st_read(dsn=\"data/geospatial\", \n                   layer=\"tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nReading layer `tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121' from data source \n  `C:\\drkrodriguez\\ISSS626-GAA\\Take-home\\Take-home_Ex01\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 77 features and 16 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 97.34336 ymin: 5.613038 xmax: 105.637 ymax: 20.46507\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe examine the loaded data to confirm the load has been done properly and to get some initial observations of the data.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### Calling Object\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nthsab_prov\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nSimple feature collection with 77 features and 16 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 97.34336 ymin: 5.613038 xmax: 105.637 ymax: 20.46507\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\nFirst 10 features:\n   Shape_Leng Shape_Area                  ADM1_EN       ADM1_TH ADM1_PCODE\n1    2.417227 0.13133873                  Bangkok  กรุงเทพมหานคร       TH10\n2    1.695100 0.07926199             Samut Prakan    สมุทรปราการ       TH11\n3    1.251111 0.05323766               Nonthaburi         นนทบุรี       TH12\n4    1.884945 0.12698345             Pathum Thani        ปทุมธานี       TH13\n5    3.041716 0.21393797 Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya พระนครศรีอยุธยา       TH14\n6    1.739908 0.07920961                Ang Thong        อ่างทอง       TH15\n7    5.693342 0.54578838                 Lop Buri          ลพบุรี       TH16\n8    1.778326 0.06872655                Sing Buri         สิงห์บุรี       TH17\n9    2.896316 0.20907828                 Chai Nat         ชัยนาท       TH18\n10   4.766446 0.29208711                 Saraburi         สระบุรี       TH19\n   ADM1_REF ADM1ALT1EN ADM1ALT2EN ADM1ALT1TH ADM1ALT2TH  ADM0_EN   ADM0_TH\n1      <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA> Thailand ประเทศไทย\n2      <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA> Thailand ประเทศไทย\n3      <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA> Thailand ประเทศไทย\n4      <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA> Thailand ประเทศไทย\n5      <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA> Thailand ประเทศไทย\n6      <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA> Thailand ประเทศไทย\n7      <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA> Thailand ประเทศไทย\n8      <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA> Thailand ประเทศไทย\n9      <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA> Thailand ประเทศไทย\n10     <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA>       <NA> Thailand ประเทศไทย\n   ADM0_PCODE       date    validOn    validTo                       geometry\n1          TH 2019-02-18 2022-01-22 -001-11-30 MULTIPOLYGON (((100.6139 13...\n2          TH 2019-02-18 2022-01-22 -001-11-30 MULTIPOLYGON (((100.7306 13...\n3          TH 2019-02-18 2022-01-22 -001-11-30 MULTIPOLYGON (((100.3415 14...\n4          TH 2019-02-18 2022-01-22 -001-11-30 MULTIPOLYGON (((100.8916 14...\n5          TH 2019-02-18 2022-01-22 -001-11-30 MULTIPOLYGON (((100.5131 14...\n6          TH 2019-02-18 2022-01-22 -001-11-30 MULTIPOLYGON (((100.3332 14...\n7          TH 2019-02-18 2022-01-22 -001-11-30 MULTIPOLYGON (((101.3453 15...\n8          TH 2019-02-18 2022-01-22 -001-11-30 MULTIPOLYGON (((100.3691 15...\n9          TH 2019-02-18 2022-01-22 -001-11-30 MULTIPOLYGON (((100.1199 15...\n10         TH 2019-02-18 2022-01-22 -001-11-30 MULTIPOLYGON (((101.3994 15...\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Checking crs information with st_crs()\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nst_crs(thsab_prov)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: WGS 84 \n  wkt:\nGEOGCRS[\"WGS 84\",\n    DATUM[\"World Geodetic System 1984\",\n        ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"latitude\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"longitude\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",4326]]\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nThe output confirms that we have a multipolygon sf object with 77 rows and 17 columns.

We refer to the OpenStreetMap wiki page to see the definition of the [different types of highways](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Thailand#Highway_classification) in the Thailand map and see that these two highway types are access roads for residences or specific buildings. For our objective, we should be able to limit to roads where accidents (are expected to frequently) happen, and only to roads that should be accessible by vehicles. Going through the definition of the highway types, we see that the following 6 types could be out of scope for our study:\n\n-   residential - road within a residential area that gives public access to one or multiple residences\n\n-   service - minor road that gives access to buildings or places outside a residential area (e.g., to a religious site, an attraction, part of an estate)\n\n-   footway - pathways designed for pedestrian access\n\n-   track - road whose only function is to provide access to surrounding land, and is most of the time unpaved\n\n-   path - multi-purpose path intended for non-motor vehicles\n\n-   steps\n\nWe can then use the following code chunk which uses the `filter()` function to remove these classifications from the current `network` object.

The very low number of accidents during rainy weather is still questionable though so we will watch out for this if we will use this variable later.\n\n# D. Non-Network-Constrained Visualization\n\nWhile we know that road accidents will only happen along the network / roads, we can still use regular spatial point pattern analysis to get some insights. We will limit this to the highest level as we just want to have some high level insights and want to spend more time working with the network constrained analysis.\n\nWe will also limit this to visualizing the KDE as we know that testing for CSR without considering the constraint of the network is inappropriate for our case.\n\n## D.1.

To do this, we effectively need to compute for the kde across years and see if there are any visible signs of shifts in the hotspots.\n\nFirst, let us try to understand the distribution of accidents by year.

The other years are within 10% of each other. We should expect that 2022 KDE may have higher numerical values compared to the other years.\n\nWe can then use the following code to generate four different kde's, one for each year.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nfor (i in c(2019, 2020, 2021, 2022)) {\n  bmracc_ppp <- as.ppp(st_geometry(filter(bmracc_jitt, Year == i)))\n  bmracc_for_kde = bmracc_ppp[bmr_owin]\n  bmracc_for_kde <- rescale.ppp(bmracc_for_kde, 1000, \"km\")\n  plot(density(bmracc_for_kde, sigma=bw.scott(X = bmracc_for_kde),\n                      edge=TRUE,kernel=\"gaussian\"), main = paste(\"KDE for year\",i))\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-50-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe see that there appears to be a shift between 2020 and 2021. Before 2020, there appeared to be two separate promininet hotspots for accidents– in the central and southeastern portion of the region. However, after 2020, it seems that the accidents are more frequent in the southeastern part, and in a much wider area.\n\n## D.3 KDE across Months\n\nWe can apply a similar approach of analysing by month using the code chunk below. For now, we are aggregating accidents by month across all years, so the insights will apply to the whole period and not any particular year.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npar(mfrow=c(3,4))\nfor (i in 1:12) {\n  bmracc_ppp <- as.ppp(st_geometry(filter(bmracc_jitt, MonthNum == i)))\n  bmracc_for_kde = bmracc_ppp[bmr_owin]\n  bmracc_for_kde <- rescale.ppp(bmracc_for_kde, 1000, \"km\")\n  plot(density(bmracc_for_kde, sigma=bw.scott(X = bmracc_for_kde),\n                      edge=TRUE,kernel=\"gaussian\"), main = paste(\"KDE for month\",i))\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-51-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe output reveals no drastic shift in hotspots (using kde) across months. There are months where the intensities and relative intensities differ, but it appears like the hotspots remain in the same areas.\n\n## D.4 KDE for Clear vs \"Rainy\" Days\n\nThe final analysis we want to perform before moving to network-constrained analysis is on clear vs non-clear days. This is indicated in the field called `weather_condition` in the accident dataset.\n\nTo produce the kde visualization, we can use the code chunk below.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\n\nbmracc_ppp <- as.ppp(st_geometry(filter(bmracc_jitt, weather_condition == \"clear\")))\nbmracc_for_kde = bmracc_ppp[bmr_owin]\nbmracc_for_kde <- rescale.ppp(bmracc_for_kde, 1000, \"km\")\nplot(density(bmracc_for_kde, sigma=bw.scott(X = bmracc_for_kde),\n             edge=TRUE,kernel=\"gaussian\"), main = \"KDE for Clear Days\")\n\nbmracc_ppp <- as.ppp(st_geometry(filter(bmracc_jitt, !(weather_condition == \"clear\"))))\nbmracc_for_kde = bmracc_ppp[bmr_owin]\nbmracc_for_kde <- rescale.ppp(bmracc_for_kde, 1000, \"km\")\nplot(density(bmracc_for_kde, sigma=bw.scott(X = bmracc_for_kde),\n             edge=TRUE,kernel=\"gaussian\"), main = \"KDE for Rainy Days\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-52-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe output are very similar too some of the charts generated earlier. The hotspot in the center of BMR appears to dissipate during rainy days. (relative to the one in the southeast portion of the region.\n\n# E. Network Constrained Visualizations and Analyses\n\nIn this section, we visualize the locations of accidents using different dimensions, especially based on time, and recognizing the constraint of the network for our particular problem. As such, we will be performing network-constrained methods from this point.\n\n## E.1 Preparation of Data for Network Constrained Analysis\n\nBefore we are able to perform network-constrained NKDE, we first need to define sample points along the road network, and to do that, we can use the midpoint of the lixels of the network.\n\n### E.1.1 Preparing the lixels\n\nTo lixelize a network, the minimum and (maximum) length of lixels need to be defined. A logical distance needs to be chosen for a given study. In our case, we might no have enough information to understand what road segment length is relevant to group accidents into. However, we can start with understanding the road lengths in the network.\n\nWe can use the code block below to show the distribution of the road length values using `summary()` to give the quartiles, and `quantile()` to give a wider range of view.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(st_length(bmr_network))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     Min.   1st Qu.

There is also a surprisingly large number of roads (\\>40%) that are less than 100m– which seem to be too short for typical roads. We can first choose a min distance of 200m which would allow for at least 40% of roads to not be split. As for the maximum length, let us first set it to 600m so only a little over 20% of the roads will be split into smaller segments.\n\nWe implement this using `lixelize_lines()` in the code chunk below.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlixels <- lixelize_lines(bmr_network$geometry, \n                         600, \n                         mindist = 200)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### E.1.2 Generating sample points\n\nThe next step is to define sample points along the network which will be the points where the KDE function will be computed on.\n\nWe can create sample points on the lixel centers using `lines_center()` in the code below.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsamples <- lines_center(lixels) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## E.2 All Years, All Accidents, Initial Analysis\n\nLet's start by looking at the highest levels. We can compute for the nkde for all accidents in the dataset (2019-2022) using the code chunk below.

If we examine the interactive map and zoom in, we see one possible reason for the problem. Major roads are being split into multiple semi-parallel roads. These might denote different directions on the same highway, service roads, etc. These might cause accidents on the same \"parent\" road to be split across their parts.\n\nWe try to solve this problem by recreating our network while merging such roads into one.\n\n## E.3 Transformation step - merging of parallel roads\n\nOne way to merge the roads, is to first use `st_buffer()` to create a width dimension on the roads. We would prefer to use the actual width of the roads, plus the islands here, but there is no way to do this accurately and this would vary from road to road. (e.g., some roads could have one lane, while others could have four or more lanes) For our case, we will use a width of 2 x 15m, which is based on a \\~3m lane width estimate, which means we are buffering up to the width of five lanes or five cars on each side.\n\nWe use the code chunk below to produce a buffered network.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbmr_network_buffered <- st_buffer(bmr_network, dist = 15)\nbmr_network_dissolved <- st_union(bmr_network_buffered)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe next step is to convert or cast this into a linestring object, but before that we would want to make sure that the geometries are simple enough so the casting is executed properly.

We can verify this using tests for CSR (Complete Spatial Randomness) using the K- or G-functions.\n\nFor our CSR test, the test hypotheses will be:\n\n-   $H_0$ - Road accidents in 2022 are randomly distributed along the BMR road network\n\n-   $H_1$ - Road accidents in 2022 are **not** randomly distributed along the BMR road network\n\nThe code chunk below runs these two functions for testing CSR using `kfunctions()` from the **spNetwork** package. We specify a range of 0m (`start`) and 2km (`end`) to evaluate the function. We also specify 50 Monte Carlo simulations (`nsim` + 1) to draw the envelope. A confidence interval (1 - `conf_int`) of 95%, and intervals of 200m for the steps and the donut width. We also use an agg argument to allow consolidation of events.

The G-function supports a view on regular distribution beyond 750m. While these differ in the details, both tests do not support CSR for the distribution of accidents in 2022.\n\n## E.5 Distribution of Accidents by Month\n\nWe can then look into the distribution of accidents across months.

One approach is to use the functions from sf package to count the accidents or events that fall within each province and then also compute for a density by computing the areas of each province.\n\nWe first compute for the number of fatal accidents that occur in each province by using `st_intersects()` function from sf package.

For this, we will also focus only on one year– 2022, as we recognize a shift in the hotspots over the years, at least across provinces\n\nTo facilitate the analysis, we create a subset of the accident dataset to only consider fatal accidents and the latest year.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbmr_fatacc_2022 <- filter(bmracc, (number_of_fatalities > 0) & (Year == 2022) )\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbmr_fatacc_2022\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nSimple feature collection with 159 features and 21 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 610274.5 ymin: 1489002 xmax: 706582.6 ymax: 1570658\nProjected CRS: WGS 84 / UTM zone 47N\n# A tibble: 159 × 22\n   acc_code incident_datetime   report_datetime     province_th  province_en  \n *    <dbl> <dttm>              <dttm>              <chr>        <chr>        \n 1  5484851 2022-01-01 02:30:00 2022-01-02 02:43:00 สมุทรปราการ   Samut Prakan \n 2  5493686 2022-01-01 05:30:00 2022-01-03 10:23:00 นนทบุรี        Nonthaburi   \n 3  5493725 2022-01-01 14:00:00 2022-01-03 10:28:00 นครปฐม       Nakhon Pathom\n 4  6950193 2022-01-03 21:00:00 2022-09-21 10:53:00 นนทบุรี        Nonthaburi   \n 5  5837858 2022-01-03 23:34:00 2022-03-03 14:19:00 กรุงเทพมหานคร Bangkok      \n 6  6567040 2022-01-04 21:19:00 2022-01-05 11:27:00 สมุทรปราการ   Samut Prakan \n 7  6567055 2022-01-09 22:00:00 2022-01-11 10:56:00 ปทุมธานี       Pathum Thani \n 8  5861456 2022-01-11 18:00:00 2022-03-07 11:28:00 สมุทรปราการ   Samut Prakan \n 9  5579080 2022-01-15 00:10:00 2022-01-15 09:11:00 กรุงเทพมหานคร Bangkok      \n10  5843213 2022-01-16 11:30:00 2022-03-04 10:48:00 ปทุมธานี       Pathum Thani \n# ℹ 149 more rows\n# ℹ 17 more variables: agency <chr>, route <chr>, vehicle_type <chr>,\n#   presumed_cause <chr>, accident_type <chr>,\n#   number_of_vehicles_involved <dbl>, number_of_fatalities <dbl>,\n#   number_of_injuries <dbl>, weather_condition <chr>, road_description <chr>,\n#   slope_description <chr>, geometry <POINT [m]>, Year <dbl>, MonthNum <dbl>,\n#   Month <ord>, DayOfWeek <ord>, fatal <lgl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThere are 159 fatal accidents in the BMR in 2022, and in the new dataset– consistent with the summary in the previous section.\n\nWe then use the following code chunk to compute for the network-constrained KDE of the 2022 fatal accidents in our network.

Conclusion\n\nWe have used techniques to visualize and analyze the road traffic accidents in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. The location of accidents is not random. There are some shifts seen in the location of hotspots across the years and across months. We have shown these using KDE and nKDE. We then focused on fatal accidents and see an increasing trend for Samut Prakan, while Nonthaburi has consistently been the most dense with regards to fatal road accidents. Further study on why these two provinces are the \"deadliest\" need to be conducted to understand if there are any features of these regions that are driving the higher incidence of fatal accidents.\n",
