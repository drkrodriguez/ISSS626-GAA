(based on an underlying property or location)\n\nWe will be using the functions of the spatstat package, and applying it to an analysis on the location of childcare centres in Singapore.\n\n# Getting Started\n\n## Data Sources\n\nData for this exercise are from public sources and include:\n\n-   Location and attribute information of childcare centres in Singapore from data.gov.sg\n\n-   Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary from [data.gov.sg](https://beta.data.gov.sg/datasets/d_d14da225fccf921049ab64238ff473d9/view)\n\n-   National boundary of Singapore provided in SLA and ESRI shapefile format\n\n## Installing and launching R packages\n\nThis exercise will make use of five R packages: **sf**, **tidyverse, spatstat, raster, maptools** and **tmap**. Among these, the new ones we are using are:\n\n-   **spatstat** - offers a wide range of functions for point pattern analysis (PPA)\n\n-   **raster** - used to read, write, manipulate and analyse models of gridded spatial data\n\nThe code chunk below uses `p_load()` of **pacman** package to check if the packages are installed in the computer. It installs them first if they are not. It then loads them into R.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse, tmap, spatstat, raster)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n# Data Loading and Preparation\n\n## Importing the Geospatial Data\n",
